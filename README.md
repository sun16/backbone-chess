# About

Hello, this is a small chess prototype using Backbone.js
I thought about putting Chess on Google Plus, but then discovered [Lichess](http://en.lichess.org/).
Lichess is pretty well put together, so I didn't see a reason to port Chess to G+.

Please note, this code is throwaway, it may not be using best practices.
If you are learning backbone, you may find this useful.

If you are interested in playing chess online, I recommend [Lichess](http://en.lichess.org/) [source code](https://github.com/ornicar/lichess)
